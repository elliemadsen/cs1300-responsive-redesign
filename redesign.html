          <h4>Sarah Muckamug</h4>
          <p>956 Old Smithfield Road, Isaac Wilkinson home
            c. 1829. Muckamug, a Nipmuc Indian, indentured to Col. Joseph Whipple, of Providence, for 12 years, had four children with Aaron Whipple, a Black slave of Whipple. Muckamug left Whipple after he refused to "maintain" their children together. She was allowed to build a wigwam on this property by the Wilkinsons. She later had another child with Fortune Burnee, a free Black man living in the community. Sarah's life shows the complex role of marriage between First Peoples and individuals of African descent.</p>

African American Lydia Brayton Willard (descended of Prince Aldrich, one of two slaves owned by Samuel Aldrich of Smithfield, RI, who purchased this land upon his freedom) inherited this property from Prince and named it for her late husband, Cato Willard. Before his death in 1834, Cato laid out Cato Street, and in 1846 Lydia platted new lots along Cato and Church streets. The neighborhood was added to the National Historic Register in 1976.</p>
